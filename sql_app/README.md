# Description 

This folder can be used in combination with the frontend folder to directly communicate. This folder is directly dependent on the frontend folder, but frontend does not have any dependencies. This way it is easy to swap out the database or instance the frontend API connects to. 

This folder is an example of how to create an sql database in the same container as the frontend.
